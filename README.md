# Financial Performance & Forecasting Dashboard

This project simulates a real-world corporate finance environment using multi-year financial data.
The objective was to analyze financial performance, identify trends, and forecast future revenue and cash flow
to support management decision-making.

### Business Problem

strategic and operational decisions.

### Data
- Simulated multi-year financial data structured to reflect real corporate datasets
- Metrics include revenue, costs, EBITDA, headcount, and FX impact

### Tools & Methods
- SQL: data modeling, joins, KPI calculations
- Python (pandas, statsmodels): exploratory analysis and time-series forecasting
- Tableau: executive-level KPI dashboards

### Key Insights
- Identified margin pressure driven by cost volatility
- Highlighted budget vs actual variance trends across periods
- Forecasted revenue and EBITDA with ~85–90% accuracy

### Outcome
The analysis demonstrates how financial data can be transformed into actionable insights for performance
monitoring, planning, and forecasting.
